        <p> Back Bay has its own stop on the commuter rail ine comming from all around the city and surronding towns. There are also intercity modes of tranportation such as busses and  subways that stop in different parts of Back Bay. Besides public transport tation their are also cabs, ubers, and lyfts. Personally the best way to travel is on foot.</p>
